## About Me

Hi, I am Yuchang Sun.

Currently, I am a Phd student of [Prof. Jun Zhang](https://eejzhang.people.ust.hk/home.html) in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

### Education

I received the B.Eng. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China in 2020.

From 2020 to 2021, I spent one year in EIE department of The Hong Kone Polytechnic University.

## Research

I am working on federated learning and distribution optimization. See my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=1WffgvYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

If you are interested in my research, welcome to discuss with me in English or Chinese.
